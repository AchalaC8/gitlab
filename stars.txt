Stars are massive, luminous spheres of plasma (hot gas, mainly hydrogen and helium) held together by gravity, shining due to internal nuclear fusion, with our Sun being the closest example. They form from collapsing gas and dust clouds, evolve through life cycles, and are fundamental building blocks of galaxies, varying greatly in size, temperature, and lifespan, with their light sometimes revealing planets in orbit. 
Key Characteristics
Composition: Primarily hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of heavier elements.
Energy Source: Nuclear fusion in their cores converts hydrogen into helium, releasing immense energy as light and heat.
Formation: Born from gravitational collapse within dense molecular clouds (stellar nurseries).
Appearance: Appear as points of light due to vast distances, but are millions of times larger than Earth.
Life Cycle: Stars evolve, changing as they age, ending as white dwarfs (smaller stars) or exploding as supernovae (massive stars). 
Classification & Types
Spectral Types: Classified by temperature and color (O, B, A, F, G, K, M), from hottest blue (O) to coolest red (M).
Our Sun: A G-type star, yellow in color, a fairly average star in size. 
Our View of Stars
Twinkling: Light from stars appears to twinkle as it passes through Earth's turbulent atmosphere.
Constellations: Groups of stars forming patterns recognized by humans.
Exoplanets: Many stars host planets, suggesting numerous potential systems like our own
