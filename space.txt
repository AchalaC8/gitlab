AI in space revolutionizes exploration by enabling autonomous navigation (like Mars rovers), enhancing mission safety through predictive maintenance (ISS), automating data analysis for faster discoveries, and creating smart assistants for astronauts (CIMON), moving towards more self-reliant, efficient, and complex deep-space missions by handling critical tasks and reducing reliance on Earth-based control despite challenges like radiation and ethical concerns.
